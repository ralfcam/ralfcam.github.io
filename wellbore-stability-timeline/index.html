				<h2>General Theory of Three‐Dimensional Consolidation</h2>
				<p>The settlement of soils under load is caused by a phenomenon called consolidation, whose mechanism is known to be in many cases identical with the process of squeezing water out of an elastic porous medium. The mathematical physical consequences of this viewpoint are established in the present paper. The number of physical constants necessary to determine the properties of the soil is derived along with the general equations for the prediction of settlements and stresses in three‐dimensional problems. Simple applications are treated as examples. The operational calculus is shown to be a powerful method of solution of consolidation problems</p>

				<h2>Theory of Elasticity and Consolidation for a Porous Anisotropic Solid</h2>
				<p>The author's previous theory of elasticity and consolidation for isotropic materials [J. Appl. Phys. 12, 155–164 (1941)] is extended to the general case of anisotropy. The method of derivation is also different and more direct. The particular cases of transverse isotropy and complete isotropy are discussed.</p>

				<h2>Rock Anisotropy and the Theory of Stress Measurements</h2>
				<p>Any undisturbed rock mass is subject to natural stresses inclu­ ding gravitational stresses due to the mass of the overburden and possibly tectonic stresses due to the straining of the earth's crust and remanent stresses due to past tectonism. Knowledge of the in situ stress field must be integrated into any rock engineering design along with general rock mass characteristics such as deformability, strength, permeability and time dependent behavior. For example, the choice of optimum orientation and shape of deep underground caverns or complex underground works will be controlled by the orientation and the magnitude of the in situ stress field if it is necessary to minimize stress concentration problems. Long term variation of the in situ stress field may also help to evaluate the potential hazard of earthquake occurences. The magnitude and orientation of the stress field ata point within a rock mass can be measured but there is no known method by which the state of stress at a point can be accurately determined by instruments located remotely. In general, measurements are made inside boreholes, on outcrops or on the internal surfaces of under­ ground cavities. Most of the measuring techniques intentionally disturb the state of stress in the rock and then measure consequent strains and displacements. Measured strains or displacements are then related to the stresses through assumptions of material behavior. A common procedure is to assume that the rock mass is linearly elastic, isotropic, continuous and homogeneous.</p>

				<h2>Stability of Highly Inclined Boreholes</h2>
				<p>Hole inclination produces alterations in the stress state around the borehole and in the physical properties of the rock. Depending on specific conditions, such effects may lead to collapse of the borehole or a reduction in the fracture-initiation pressure. This paper shows how to determine such effects through the application of stress analysis and rock mechanics.</p>

				<h2>Poroelastic response of a borehole in a non-hydrostatic stress field</h2>
				<p>This paper deals with the solution of the stress, displacement, and pore pressure field induced by the drilling and/or the pressurization of a vertical borehole. The rock, which is permeated by fluid, is assumed to behave as a poroelastic material with compressible constituents, following the Biot theory. The analytical solution is derived in the Laplace transform space, and is transformed to the time domain using an approximate numerical inversion technique. The solution reveals a full range of coupled poroelastic effects which provide potential mechanisms for delayed borehole instability and shear fracture initiation inside the rock.</p>

				<h2>Influence of anisotropies in borehole stability</h2>
				<p>This paper discusses an anisotropic model for assessing the mechanical stability of a deep borehole subjected to an internal wellbore pressure and a far-field stress tensor. The model consists of a three-dimensional stress analysis around an inclined borehole combined with a generalized three-dimensional anisotropic strength criterion for assessing shear fracturing. Parametric studies indicated that the stability of a wellbore is influenced significantly by rock anisotropy, rock strength anisotropy, and in-situ stress differentials when it is highly inclined and oriented in the direction parallel to the maximum horizontal in-situ stress. The influence of anisotropies is more pronounced on passive shear failure caused by wellbore pressurization.</p>

				<h2>Material coefficients of anisotropic poroelasticity</h2>
				<p>The material coefficients of Biot's anisotropic poroelasticity are interpreted following micromechanical considerations. The adoption of the micro-homogeneity and micro-isotropy assumptions leads to a most practical model for laboratory measurement: the material is defined within 21 drained elastic constants Mijkl, a solid grain bulk modulus Ks, and a Biot modulus M. To facilitate engineering applications, relations among Hookean, engineering and micromechanical constitutive constants are explicitly and extensively listed. These relations are used to convert a set of anisotropic data measured in traditional engineering tests under undrained condition to various continuum mechanical constants.</p>

				<h2>On generalized plane strain poroelasticity</h2>
				<p>Generalized plane strain is characterized by geometries of cylinders of finite or infinite length with boundary conditions that do not change in the direction of the generators. The resultant field generally contain three-dimensional stress and strain components, but has only two-dimensional spatial dependency. In addition to the classical plane strain deformation, it admits axial strain, warping, torsion, shear, bending, among other elementary deformation modes. The study of generalized plane strain solutions has so far been limited to elasticity. The present paper seeks the parallel development for poroelasticity. Due to the mathematical difficulty arising from the coupled nature of poroelasticity, analyses here are restricted to materials with orthotropic properties and cylindrical geometries whose longitudinal axis coincides with one of the material principal axes.</p>

				<h2>Poroelastic solutions in transversely isotropic media for wellbore and cylinder</h2>
				<p>This paper presents closed-form solutions for the pore pressures and stress fields for the inclined borehole and the cylinder, induced by boundary stress perturbation in an anisotropic poroelastic medium. The governing equations for the transversely isotropic poroelastic materials under the cylindrical coordinate system are presented. The solution for the inclined borehole, subjected to a three-dimensional far-field anisotropic stress field, is derived with the borehole generator coinciding with the material axis of symmetry ; while the solutions for the cylinder are obtained under various loading conditions that are encountered in laboratory testing procedures. The analysis shows, in addition to the effect of time on stress and pore pressure variations, that poromechanical anisotropic material coefficients also play an important role in calculating the in-plane stress fields, which is not the case using the classical anisotropic theory of elasticity.</p>

				<h2>Wellbore-Stability Predictions by Use of a Modified Lade Criterion</h2>
				<p>The two most commonly used rock failure criteria in wellbore stability analyses are the Mohr-Coulomb criterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion. Neither of these is compatible with three-dimensional rock strength measurements that have explored the influence of the intermediate principal stress. This paper presents a modified Lade criterion which has the following desirable qualities: 1. it correctly describes the influence of the intermediate stress on rock strength, and therefore on wellbore stability, 2. it can be rearranged to give a closed-form solution for critical mud weight, for any wellbore orientation, and 3. only two rock strength parameters are required, such as cohesion and friction angle. The modified Lade criterion predicts critical mud weight values that are less conservative than those predicted by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion yet are not as unconservative as those predicted by the Drucker-Prager criterion. It also reveals that the required increase in mud weight when going from low hole angle to high hole angle is not as great as predicted by either the Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager criteria.</p>

				<h2>A failure criterion for transversely isotropic rocks</h2>
				<p>In this paper, a new failure criterion for the transversely isotropic rocks is presented. The new criterion is based on two distinct failure modes; one is the sliding mode where the failure is caused by sliding along the discontinuity, and the other is the non-sliding mode where the failure is controlled by the rock material and is not dependent on discontinuity. This failure criterion is defined with seven material parameters. The physical meanings of, and the procedures for determining, these parameters are described. Both the original Jaeger criterion and the extended Jaeger criterion are shown to be special cases of the proposed criterion. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed failure criterion are examined using the published experimental data. The data used cover various types of transversely isotropic rocks, different orientation angels and confining pressures. The predicted strength behaviors of the transversely isotropic rocks agree well with the experimental data from various investigators. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed empirical failure criterion are demonstrated in this paper.</p>

				<h2>A study of wellbore stability in shales including poroelastic, chemical, and thermal effects</h2>
				<p>This paper presents the development of a model for determining wellbore stability for oil and gas drilling operations. The effects of mechanical forces and poroelasticity on shale behavior are included, as well as chemical and thermal effects. <br> Chemical effects are caused by the imbalance between the water activity in the drilling mud and the shale water activity. The magnitude of this contribution depends on the effectiveness of the mud/shale system to perform as a semipermeable membrane. Experimental results show that osmotic pressures develop inside shales when they are exposed to different drilling fluids. This osmotic pressure is treated as an equivalent hydraulic potential, and is then added to the hydraulic wellbore and pore pressure as time progresses. <br> Thermal diffusion inside the drilled formation induces additional pore pressure and rock stress changes and consequently affects shale stability. Thermal effects are important because thermal diffusion into shale formations occurs more quickly than hydraulic diffusion and thereby dominates pore pressure changes during early time. <br> Rock temperature and pore pressure are coupled for most porous media studies; however, we have found that they can be partially decoupled for shale formations by assuming that convective heat transfer is negligible. The partially decoupled temperature and pore pressure effects can therefore be solved analytically under appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Experimental data for shale strength alteration, which occurs when shales are exposed to different fluids, are also included for the determination of cohesion strength decay. <br> Pore pressure, collapse stress, and critical mud weights are variables investigated for determining poroelastic, chemical, and thermal effects on shale stability. The most important factors, which affect wellbore stability, are clearly identified.</p>

				<h2>Thermoporoelastic Effect on Wellbore Stability</h2>
				<p>This paper presents the consistency of thermal effects (i.e., thethermal-induced pore pressure and rock stresses) between two available modelsfor inclined boreholes. Thermal effects for both a permeable and an impermeable boundary are studied. The solutions of pore pressure and stresses are provided,and the singularity is solved in the solutions for the condition of hydraulic diffusivity being equal to thermal diffusivity. The analytical solutions in the Laplace domain and in the real-time domain are verified using thefinite-difference solutions. The collapse failure index and critical mudweights, as well as thermally induced pore pressure, are presented and analyzedunder the circumstances of heating and cooling the wellbore. Results show that heating the wellbore can destabilize the near-wellbore region by raising both the collapse and the fracturing mud weight. The model presented in this papercan be applicable to deepwater drilling, where a narrow mud-weight window often occurs.</p>

				<h2>Incorporating Thermochemoporoelastic Effects in Wellbore Stability Design in Shales</h2>
				<p>This paper presents a coupled thermochemoporoelastic model to compute solute concentration, temperature, pore pressure and stress around a wellbore drilled through shales using water-based fluids. Although the model has both an analytical and a numerical solution, herein we present only the former and its application to wellbore stability analysis in shales. The analysis is conducted so that the individual impacts of each model parameter on wellbore stability can be examined. The results show that to optimize the determination of wellbore drilling pressures it is necessary to first specify appropriate temperature and solute concentration of the drilling fluid. In order to obtain a wider stability window, a methodology for managing collapse pressures was applied. We compare the pore pressure changes due to thermal and chemical effects from the analytical solution to results obtained with the numerical solution of the model in order to demonstrate the robustness of the analytical model.</p>

				<h2>Improving Horizontal Completions on Heterogeneous Tight-Shales</h2>
				<p>Production from nanodarcy-range permeability shale formations requires extensive hydraulic fracturing, large volumes of water, and close-spaced wells. The current trend, which includes increasing lateral lengths, increasing the number of perforation stages, and increasing the volume of water and proppants pumped, is unsustainable. Comparing calculations of the possible surface area created during fracturing versus production results indicate that a large portion of the surface area is ineffective to production, resulting in ineffective use of resources and increased costs. This paper describes the fundamental understanding required to improve the efficiency of horizontal completions in oil- and gas-producing shales. Using extensive laboratory characterization of mechanical properties on core, core/log integration, and continuous mapping of these properties by logging-while-drilling (LWD) methods along the horizontal wellbore, appropriate guidelines are defined for effective perforation and fracturing to improve the efficiency and sustainability of horizontal completions. The objective of the study is to improve completion design and horizontal well completions efficiency. This objective is achieved by adequate selection of perforation intervals based on understanding the relevant physical processes and adequate rock characterization. Two reservoir regions, the near-wellbore and the far-wellbore, are defined and essential to completion design. Conditions at the far-wellbore region, which define the extent of the surface area in contact with the reservoir, are fundamental to well productivity. However, these conditions are often poorly understood. The near-wellbore region is the choking point to production, provided that ideal far-wellbore conditions exist. Properties along the near-wellbore region can be measured and are better understood. In this paper, these properties are used to minimize the near-wellbore choking effect by evaluating rock types that maximize near-wellbore fracture width, minimize breakdown pressures, and reduce the potential of solids production during the initial drawdown. The result is a nonsubjective and consistent methodology that defines the variability in near-well fracture performance along wellbores and allows selecting perforation stages based on measured or inferred rock properties (from LWD or drill cuttings analysis). Finally, the method that will be described provides a means for monitoring and comparing consistency between the predicted values and measured results by comparing the results to actual production data. The results of this study show the need to better understand the far-wellbore conditions as well as the near-wellbore conditions when making inferences about well production.</p>

				<h2>Effect of Weak Bedding Planes on Wellbore Stability for Shale Gas Wells</h2>
				<p>For shale gas reservoirs with the characteristics of bedding planes developed, hydrated easily and strong anisotropy of the mechanical properties, this paper couples conventional logging, image logging and real-time drilling data with laboratory rock mechanical and in-site stress tests, and establishes a wellbore stability analysis model for shale reservoirs. This analysis covers weak bedding planes, mechanical anisotropy and time effects. <br> Besides, the effect of these above factors on the wellbore stability for horizontal wells in shale reservoirs is studied, and wellbore collapse mechanism for the shale reservoirs in Sichuan Basin is also analyzed. <br> Based on the established wellbore stability analysis model, this paper analyses the well W-H1, the analysis results are in good agreement with real drilling data. <br> Study and field application results indicate that weak bedding plane effects mainly affect wellbore collapse of horizontal wells for shale reservoirs, which differs from conventional sand reservoirs and carbonate reservoirs, even for the vertical wells in the shale reservoirs. <br> The study provides a theoretical basis for W-H1 well drilling and completion design, such as drilling fluid design, wellbore structure optimization and completion method optimization, etc.</p>

				<h2>A wellbore stability model for formations with anisotropic rock strengths</h2>
				<p>Shale formations, due to the presence of laminations and weak planes, exhibit directional strength characteristics. In most conventional wellbore stability analyses, rock formations are typically assumed to have isotropic strength. This may cause erroneous results in anisotropic formations such as shales which show strength variations with changing loading directions with respect to the plane of weakness. Therefore a more complex wellbore stability model is required. We have developed such a model in which the anisotropic rock strength characteristic is incorporated. Applying this model to two case studies shows that shear failures occur either along or across the bedding planes depending on the relative orientation between the wellbore trajectories and the bedding planes. Additionally, the extent of failure region around the wellbore and the safe mud weights are significantly affected by the wellbore orientation with respect to the directions of bedding plane and in-situ stress field.</p>

				<h2>Effect of anisotropic borehole wall failures when estimating in situ stresses: A case study in the Nankai accretionary wedge</h2>
				<p>Breakouts observed in a vertical borehole (C0002A) drilled through two major tectonic sedimentary formations consisting of forearc basin (upper) and accretionary prism (lower) sediments in the Nankai accretionary wedge, Japan, exhibit distinctive geometric features in respective formations. Breakouts in the lower accretionary prism sediments are markedly wider than those in the forearc basin sediments, and breakout azimuths in the two units are horizontally rotated relative to one another. Breakout azimuths are widely used as a proxy for the determination of principal stress directions. However, strength anisotropies related to the presence of bedding planes may affect both breakout azimuths and widths, which can result in misleading in situ stress interpretations. While thinly bedded mudstones are the dominant lithology in both the forearc basin and accretionary prism sediments, bedding planes in the accretionary prism sediments are relatively steeper than those in the forearc basin sediments, with possible implications for breakout geometry and interpretations of principal stress directions. To investigate the effects of bedding planes on breakout geometry (azimuth and width), we conducted borehole wall failure analyses using a weak-plane failure model that incorporates material strength anisotropies. The model results show that breakout widths and orientations are strongly affected by steeply dipping (>40°) bedding planes in cases where dip directions are unaligned with the principal stress orientation. Our theoretical results suggest that variations in breakout azimuths in the C0002A site may be associated with bedding plane related strength anisotropy, and not associated with the rotation of stress field. That is, stress orientation is consistent throughout the borehole (down to the bottom-hole depth of 1495 m below sea floor). In addition, disregarding the effects of bedding planes tends to yield an overestimation of in situ stress magnitude.</p>

				<h2>Practical application of failure criteria in determining safe mud weight windows in drilling operations</h2>
				<p>Wellbore instability is reported frequently as one of the most significant incidents during drilling operations. Analysis of wellbore instability includes estimation of formation mechanical properties and the state of in situ stresses. In this analysis, the only controllable parameter during drilling operation is the mud weight. If the mud weight is larger than anticipated, the mud will invade into the formation, causing tensile failure of the formation. On the other hand, a lower mud weight can result in shear failures of rock, which is known as borehole breakouts. To predict the potential for failures around the wellbore during drilling, one should use a failure criterion to compare the rock strength against induced tangential stresses around the wellbore at a given mud pressure. The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion is one of the commonly accepted criteria for estimation of rock strength at a given state of stress. However, the use of other criteria has been debated in the literature. In this paper, Mohr–Coulomb, Hoek–Brown and Mogi–Coulomb failure criteria were used to estimate the potential rock failure around a wellbore located in an onshore field of Iran. The log based analysis was used to estimate rock mechanical properties of formations and state of stresses. The results indicated that amongst different failure criteria, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion underestimates the highest mud pressure required to avoid breakouts around the wellbore. It also predicts a lower fracture gradient pressure. In addition, it was found that the results obtained from Mogi–Coulomb criterion yield a better comparison with breakouts observed from the caliper logs than that of Hoek–Brown criterion. It was concluded that the Mogi–Coulomb criterion is a better failure criterion as it considers the effect of the intermediate principal stress component in the failure analysis.</p>

				<h2>Anisotropic Wellbore Stability Model and Its Application for Drilling through Challenging Shale Gas Wells</h2>
				<p>This paper describes a new anisotropic wellbore stability model and its application in a challenging shale gas well in China. Wells drilled through laminated rocks like shales –particularly deviated wells such as laterals - are often less stable than comparable wells drilled into non-laminated rocks. This results in significant wellbore instability issues that can elevate drilling operation costs substantially. Traditional wellbore stability analysis considers the formation as a homogeneous isotropic material using isotropic elastic near wellbore stresses together with isotropic borehole failure criteria such as Mohr-Coulomb. In anisotropic rocks, for example in highly laminated shales and fractured rocks, those models are no longer valid as borehole failure can occur along weak planes. <br> We have developed such an anisotropic wellbore stability model in which the rock anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic strength characteristic are incorporated. Near borehole induced stress is computed by Lekhnitskii-Amadei solution to account formation anisotropic behavior, and wellbore shear failure mechanism is modeled by a modified Plane-of-Weakness model, where the classical Plane-of-Weakness failure criterion is adopted to identify the onset of rock sliding along a weak plane; and the active shearing effect is adopted to judge whether the onset sliding at the borehole wall will develop and cause borehole instability. Arbitrary bedding/fracture orientations as well as arbitrary wellbore trajectory and in situ stress orientation is considered by this model. The model can predict the extent of failure region around the wellbore and then provide mud weight window for safe and effective drilling. <br> Additionally, this approach was programmed into a software system and applied to a field case study - wellbore stability analysis and mud weight computation for a slightly deviated pilot well drilling through laminated shales.  The laminated shales are penetrated by high-angle natural fractures. Our modeling results shows the design borehole can be drilled without encounting severe instability issue, however, borehole damage due to either weak planes (laminated layers and fractures) sliding or rock matrix shear failure were predicted. The borehole damage mode and severity is largely dependent on borehole relative orientation with the weak planes, and the directions and magnitudes of the in situ three principal stresses. The computed borehole damage was compared to borehole image (FMI) and caliper measurement and gave a good agreement.  Subsequently this model was applied to predict the mud weight window for an Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) in the field and provide wellbore stability analysis to drill high-deviated wells in the area. We showed that this developed model is effective to provide insight in understanding borehole failure mechanisms, and provide more reasonable mud weight window which can be used to effectively mitigate wellbore instabilities in anisotropic condition.</p>
